/* Problem Statement: Venue Booking System
Your task is to build a Venue Booking System website for college students to request and reserve
venues for their events. The system should allow students to book venues for specific dates and
times, and submit their booking requests for admin approval.
Features:


1. Student Registration & Login:
o Students should be able to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
o Authentication using username and password.


2. Venue Availability:
o The website should display available venues and their current booking status
(booked or available).
o Users should be able to filter venues by capacity, location, and availability.


3. Booking Requests:
o Students can select a venue, specify the date, time slot, and event details, then
submit a booking request.
o Multiple time slots can be booked for a single day.


4. Admin Approval Workflow:
o Booking requests are sent to the admin panel for review.
o Admins should be able to approve, reject, or request modifications to the bookings.


5. Booking History:
o Students can view their booking history (both approved and pending requests).


6. Notifications:
o Students receive notifications on the status of their booking (approved, rejected,
pending).


7. Admin Dashboard:
o Admins should have a dashboard to manage booking requests, with the ability to
view, approve, or reject them.
o Admins can also see the list of upcoming events and venue schedules.
